# Personal Software Engineer Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio started in 2020 as a small inspiration to stand out among internship recruiters which has since spiraled into a dedicated and important project. It's meant to represent my resume in a website format, showcasing my education, work history, projects, and interests/hobbies. It was/is a way for internship recruiters, collegues, and professional connections to easily find and contact me.
